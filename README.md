# micrograd plus
![](/puppy/puppy.jpg)

micrograd plus is a lean, but mean autograd engine that hopefully extends [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

#### Features
* [ ] Extended Operations (Logarithm, Trigonometric Functions, Activation Functions)
* [ ] Optimization Algorithms (SGD,RMSprop, Adam)
* [ ] Loss Functions (MSE, MAE, Cross-Entropy)
* [ ] Interface for Neural Network Models
* [ ] Tests for All New Features
* [ ] Example Notebooks for Machine Learning Problems

#### Tasks
* [x] Vectorized Operations: The Value class in [engine.py](/microgradplus/engine.py) has been updated to support NumPy arrays. The gradient is also stored as a NumPy array, and a gradient function can be provided to compute the gradient of complex operations.
