- [x] `_grad_fn`: to store the gradient calculation logic specific to the operation that produced the `Value`
- [x] `__repr__`: repr operator to display the data and it's gradient when printed
- [x] `__add__`: addition operator with grad func(works on scalars, arrays, and matrices)
- [x] `Context`: ctx to store the arrays for backprop
- [x] `backward`: backward pass of the computation, calculating gradients for all nodes in the computation graph by chain rule
- [x] `__mul__`: element-wise multiplication operator with grad func(works on scalars, arrays, and matrices)
